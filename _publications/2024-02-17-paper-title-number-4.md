### Summary
LocoTouch studies tactile-aware learning for **dynamic quadrupedal transport**. The core idea is to use distributed tactile sensing to improve robustness during long-horizon carrying tasks, especially under contact uncertainty.

### My Contribution
- Co-developed tactile-aware transport learning pipeline and evaluation (details on my Research page / resume).
