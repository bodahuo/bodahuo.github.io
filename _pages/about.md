## About

I’m an M.S. student in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (expected May 2026). I completed my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at UC Santa Barbara in 2024.

My research goal is to make robots **reliably perceive and act under contact uncertainty**. I work on tactile sensing systems and learning-based control for contact-rich tasks, with an emphasis on real-world robustness.

## Research interests
- Visual–tactile sensing and piezoresistive tactile arrays  
- Learning-based whole-body control for contact-rich robotics  
- Sim-to-real reinforcement learning and evaluation for robustness and safety  

## Selected work

**LocoTouch (CoRL 2025).**  
I worked on tactile-aware dynamic transport for quadrupeds, combining distributed tactile sensing with a learning pipeline designed to transfer from simulation to real hardware. The project studies how tactile feedback improves stability and robustness when carrying unsecured objects over long horizons.

**LightTact (arXiv 2025, † equal contribution).**  
I developed a visual–tactile fingertip sensor aimed at deformation-independent contact sensing. The key idea is to capture both deformation signals and surface appearance cues (e.g., color/text), enabling robust contact understanding across a wide range of materials and contact conditions.

## Currently
- Building and calibrating tactile sensing hardware for reliable contact signals  
- Developing tactile-aware policies and evaluation protocols for real robots  
- Studying sim-to-real transfer for contact-rich manipulation and locomotion
